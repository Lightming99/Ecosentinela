# Placeholder for Poppins font files
# In a real project, you would download and place the actual font files here:
# - Poppins-Regular.ttf
# - Poppins-Medium.ttf
# - Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
# - Poppins-Bold.ttf
# 
# You can download these from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins
# For now, the app will use the system default font if these files are not present.
